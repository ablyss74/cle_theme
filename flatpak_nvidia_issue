Possible issue and fix for nvidia users and adding a remote flatpak as described in the theme where flatpak fails
to see the nvidia driver loaded on the system.  To fix this I removed "rm -fr" $HOME/.local/share/flatpak as well
as from other users on the system and reinstalled flatpak with swupd. After that I added the flatpak hub as described 
in the theme instructions and flatpak saw that the nvidia driver was actually loaded and installed the proper driver.

This maybe an isolated and/or maybe rare issue but just throwing it out incase anyone runs into it.  And also I'm
not 100% sure that the instructions above actually did the fix but there ya go.

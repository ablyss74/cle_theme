Possible issue and fix for nvidia users and adding a remote flatpak as described in the theme were flatpak fails
to see the nvidia driver loaded on the system.  To fix this I removed "rm -fr" $HOME/.local/share/flatpak and
reinstalled flatpak with swupd.  After that I added the flatpak hub as described in the thtme instructions and
flatpak saw the nvidia driver was actually loaded and installed the proper driver.

This maybe an isolated and or maybe rare issue but just throwing it out incase anyone runs into it.  And also I'm
not 100% sure that instructions above actually did the fix but there ya go.

New User Tip:
The home directory is empty, except for the Desktop folder, unless your logged in accidentally into Gnome.org first, or are in single user mode.
This is so you can create your own icon designs and folder layout.

Baisc to Set An Icon:

First open up home folder, then click a random empty spot and select `New` then select `Directory`.
	Then click the new folder and select `File Properties` at the bottom.
		Uncheck `use this icon for all files of this type`,
			Then click the Blue Icon Folder,
				Then select the little folder called icons on the left,
					Scroll down and find a different icon to design. 
				Click OK
		You may need apply twice, 
	or select thumbnail first to see
it change settings.
					

Single User Mode Notes:

Some icons that are set will follow thru to Gnome.org display manager and may disappear if theme is replaced or broken.
But easy to fix - just reopen enlightenment, load the app, and give it a new icon.
